# Ideas
---------------------------------------------------
### Things that are planed
- Nested Folders
- Tagging photos (with words)
- Favorite folders (marking some photos as fav)
- Importing folders directly into albums
- RAW support
- Importing/exporting videos
- Supporting Apple live photos
- Manually add GPS tag
- Export to other formats
- Importing directly from connected mobile devices

### Performence improvements - line of research
- Making hash algorithm faster (or choosing a faster one)
- SQLite queries
- Thumbnail creation
- File copy

### Performance improvments examples
- Coding hash algorithm in asm ([example for md5](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-md5-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly))
- Sqlite preparing individually requests (not using exec)

### Other ideas
- Archiving (backuping) a library | unarchiving a library (using zlib)
- At import list all photos with GPS coordinates for showing them on a map

### Things that are probablt gonna be plugins/modules
- Automatic tagging (with AI)
- Face recognition (tagging people on photos with AI for suggestions)
- Syncinc across other ospl libraries
