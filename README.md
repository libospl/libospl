# OSPL - Open Source Photo Library

OSPL is a slick API for managing your photos. It manages to be cross-platform by not providing a GUI (which are extremely platform dependent). It performs all the functions that a regular GUI photo manager can do, such as importing photos or tagging. The GUIs only do one thing: provide a graphical interface for this API (and other API's to provide image editing, which OSPL does not do).

This is a work-in-progress, see [here](https://github.com/users/AngeloFrangione/projects/3/views/1) for the project's planned features.
